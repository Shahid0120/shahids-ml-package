# shahids-ml-package

Hi! This repository aims to create my personal Python machine learning package, inspired by well-known packages such as scikit-learn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

# Why did I decide to do this?

After taking CS290 at Stanford, I noticed that while following other tutorials on existing machine learning packages provided me with the skills to implement machine learning algorithms, it didn't offer the foundational understanding of how to create these algorithms from scratch, as the CS290 course had taught me.

Therefore, in my pursuit to improve my programming and algorithm skills, I will attempt to create my own machine learning algorithms!
